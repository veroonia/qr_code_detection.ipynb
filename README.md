# QR Code Detection using Computer Vision

This project implements a QR code detection pipeline using Python and classical computer vision techniques. The system processes input images, applies preprocessing and feature analysis, and detects QR codes using OpenCV-based image processing methods.

The project demonstrates practical skills in image analysis, algorithmic problem solving, and computer vision workflows, and was developed in a Google Colab environment.
